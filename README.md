# projets-
A repository where I upload my programing projects. I'll try my best to document all the things and changes I do. I hope to learn something with all my (future) fails. There's been some hard times in my life where I found myself lost, without a sight to where should I go or what should I do. After 9 years of trying to find my path, I decided to try once again this thing, learning to programing. My goal is to learn the needfulls skills to become a Data Analyst and work with data, if its possible, about Space Weather. In the mean time, I'll keep reading, learning, trying and failling. 
But I guess thats where the fun lies.

To Me in the future: I hope you are fine, keep working hard, and take care of yourself, your family, and the friends you made since 2018. Those people worth your time.
And keep learning German!! 
Auf wiedersehen!
